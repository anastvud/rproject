```{r}
roll_stone <- readr::read_csv("rolling_stone.csv")

roll_stone <- roll_stone %>% mutate(genre = str_to_title(genre))

# Display the first few rows
head(roll_stone)

```

### **Top genres by average Spotify popularity**

At first we need to remove rows where genre is NA and group by genre. After doing this, we need to find average from column spotify_popularity. The range is 0 - 100 and the buggest the number, more popular the album is. So the most popular are Latin albums

```{r}
roll_stone %>%
  filter(!is.na(genre)) %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(avg_popularity = mean(spotify_popularity, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_popularity))
```

### Average age of band members for each genre at the moment of debut

At first we need to calculate average age of artists at the moment of debut. After that we filter the data, so that we only take bands, which has genre. We group by genre and find average value. Groups with the youngest members are in Rock N' Roll/Rhythm & Blues and the oldest in Latin.

```{r}
roll_stone %>%
  mutate(avg_age = (release_year - (artist_birth_year_sum / artist_member_count))) %>%
  filter(artist_member_count > 1 & !is.na(genre)) %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(avg_band_age = mean(avg_age, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_band_age)) 
```

### Number of albums from each genre in each rank 

To count the numbers of albums in each rank by genre we needed to transform columns like "rank_2003" to longer data. Name of the column transformed to "rank_year" and values were added to column "rank". After that we needed to filter out genres and rank, group by it and summarize.

```{r}
number_of_albums_from_each_genre_in_each_rank <- roll_stone %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("rank_"),
               names_to = "rank_year",
               values_to = "rank") %>%
  filter(!is.na(rank) & !is.na(genre)) %>%
  group_by(genre, rank_year) %>% 
  summarise(album_count = n(), .groups = "drop") 

number_of_albums_from_each_genre_in_each_rank
```

### Heatmap of number of albums from each genre in each rank

We are using previously calculated *number_of_albums_from_each_genre_in_each_rank* an vizualyzing it in a heatmap

```{r}
selected_colors <- c(stepped(20)[3], stepped(20)[11], stepped(20)[19])


ggplot(number_of_albums_from_each_genre_in_each_rank,
       aes(x = rank_year, y = genre, fill = album_count)) +
  
  geom_tile(color = "white", linewidth = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(
    colors = selected_colors,
    name = "Album Count",
    breaks = seq(0, max(number_of_albums_from_each_genre_in_each_rank$album_count) - 10, by = 10)
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Number of Albums in Ranking",
       x = "Ranking Year",
       y = "Genre") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),
        legend.position = "right")
```

### Word cloud of the most used words

We are selecting names of the albums, tokenizing it, removing articles and other words that don't have meaning and then using function *worldcloud*, which does the vizualization. The most common word is love.

```{r}
album_words <- roll_stone %>%
  select(album) %>% 
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(word, album) %>%  
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

album_words %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% print()

selected_colors <- c(stepped(20)[9], stepped(20)[10], stepped(20)[13], stepped(20)[14], stepped(20)[17], stepped(20)[18])

wordcloud(
  words = album_words$word, 
  freq = album_words$n, 
  min.freq = 4,
  max.words = 50,
  random.order = FALSE,
  colors = selected_colors
)
```

### Top 10 albums which gained the most places from 2003 to 2020

At first we need to filter the albums that aren't in 2003 or 2020 rankings. After we arrange them by *differential* and choose top 10

```{r}
roll_stone %>%
  filter(!is.na(rank_2003) & !is.na(rank_2020)) %>%
  arrange(desc(differential)) %>% 
  select(clean_name, album, rank_2003, rank_2020, differential) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)
```

### Top 10 albums that improved the most (positive) and dropped the most (negative)

At first we need to filter the albums that aren't in 2003 or 2020 rankings. After we arrange them by *differential* ascending or descending and choose top 10.

```{r}
top_improved <- roll_stone %>%
  filter(!is.na(rank_2003) & !is.na(rank_2020)) %>%
  arrange(desc(differential)) %>% 
  select(clean_name, album, rank_2003, rank_2020, differential) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)
top_improved

top_dropped <- roll_stone %>%
  filter(!is.na(rank_2003) & !is.na(rank_2020)) %>%
  arrange(differential) %>%
  select(clean_name, album, rank_2003, rank_2020, differential) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)
top_dropped
```

### Which percent of the albums in top charts have special characters in their name?

At first, we need to define special characters. We decided not to add here dot or comma, since they are quite common. Then we count with function *grepl* how many albums have special characters in their name and divide it by the number of distinct names of the albums

```{r}
special_characters <- "[!@#$%^&*()_+={}|:;\"<>?/~`\\]"

albums_with_special_chars <- roll_stone %>%
  filter(grepl(special_characters, album)) %>%
  select(album)

num_special_char_albums <- nrow(albums_with_special_chars)

total_albums <- nrow(roll_stone %>% distinct(album))

percentage_special_char_albums <- (num_special_char_albums / total_albums) * 100

num_special_char_albums
percentage_special_char_albums
```

# Albums that placed in top 25 in all three years

Here we choose albums that were ranked in top 25 in all three rankings

```{r}
roll_stone %>%
  filter(rank_2003 <= 25 & rank_2012 <= 25 & rank_2020 <= 25) %>%
  select(clean_name, album, genre, rank_2003, rank_2012, rank_2020)
```

### Average Age by Genre and Artist Gender in 2003

At first we need to filter the data, remove NA records from genre and artist gender. After that we calculate average birth_year fo artists for groups and take exact birth year for solo artists and calculate age in 2003. Then we group it by genre and artist gender and calculate average age for each gender and genre. For some genres there aren't any female artists or groups that have both female and male members. We can see that usually age of the female artists is lower in almost all genres.

```{r}
average_birthyear_by_genre_gender <- roll_stone %>%
  filter(!is.na(artist_gender) & !is.na(genre)) %>%
  mutate(birth_year = ifelse(artist_member_count > 1,
                             artist_birth_year_sum / artist_member_count,
                             artist_birth_year_sum)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(artist_gender) & !is.na(birth_year)) %>% 
  mutate(age = (2003 - birth_year)) %>%  
  group_by(genre, artist_gender) %>%
  summarise(average_birthyear = mean(birth_year, na.rm = TRUE), 
            average_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),  
            .groups = "drop")

selected_colors <- c(stepped(20)[3], stepped(20)[15], stepped(20)[11])

ggplot(average_birthyear_by_genre_gender, aes(x = genre, y = average_age, color = artist_gender, group = artist_gender)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + 
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  labs(title = "Average Age by Genre and Artist Gender in 2003",
       x = "Genre",
       y = "Average Age",
       color = "Artist Gender") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray80")) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(20, 80), breaks = seq(20, 80, by = 10)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = selected_colors)
```

### Correlation Between Average Birth Year and Rank by Year and Genre

At first we need to filter the data, remove NA records from genre and artist gender. After that we calculate average birth_year fo artists for groups and take exact birth year for solo artists. We need to make longer data, so that we can implement the plot. Names go to *rank_year* and values to *rank.* Then we need to filter again, remove NA records if exist for birth_year and rank. We can see that a lot of artists were born in 1940-1950 years, which makes sense, since there was a "baby boom" after the II World War.

```{r}
debut_age_rank_data <- roll_stone %>%
  filter(!is.na(artist_gender) & !is.na(genre)) %>%
  mutate(birth_year = ifelse(artist_member_count > 1,
                             artist_birth_year_sum / artist_member_count,
                             artist_birth_year_sum)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("rank_"),
               names_to = "rank_year",
               values_to = "rank") %>%
  filter(!is.na(birth_year) & !is.na(rank)) %>% 
  mutate(rank_year = gsub("rank_", "", rank_year))

plot <- ggplot(debut_age_rank_data, aes(x = rank, y = birth_year)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 3, aes(color = genre)) +
  labs(title = "Correlation Between Average Birth Year and Rank by Year and Genre",
       x = "Rank",
       y = "Average Birth Year",
       color = "Genre") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + 
  facet_wrap(~rank_year, scales = "fixed") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = stepped(15)) +  # Use 15 colors from the stepped palette
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1910, 2000), 
                     breaks = seq(1910, 2000, by = 10)) +  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 500, by = 100)) +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"))

plot

ggsave("larger_graph.jpg", plot = plot, width = 16, height = 10, dpi = 300)
```

### Spotify Presence by Genre

We decided to see how many artists from different genres doesn't have Spotify (we thought that everyone has). So we created additional column *has_spotify*, grouped by it and genre, summarized and added percentage. Donut charts are very helpful in showing such information, so we decided to use them.

```{r}
spotify_analysis <- roll_stone %>%
  filter(!is.na(genre)) %>% 
  mutate(has_spotify = ifelse(!is.na(spotify_url), "Has Spotify", "No Spotify")) %>%
  group_by(genre, has_spotify) %>%
  summarise(album_count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(percent = album_count / sum(album_count) * 100, .by = genre)


selected_colors <- c(stepped(20)[19], stepped(20)[20])
plot <- ggplot(spotify_analysis, aes(x = 2, y = percent, fill = has_spotify)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  geom_text(data = spotify_analysis %>% filter(has_spotify == "No Spotify" & percent > 0),
            aes(label = paste0(round(percent, 1), "%"), y = percent / 2), 
            size = 4) +
  facet_wrap(~genre, nrow = 3) +
  labs(title = "Spotify Presence by Genre", fill = "Spotify Status") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14)) +
  xlim(1.5, 2.5) + xlim(0.5, 2.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = selected_colors)
plot

ggsave("larger_graph.jpg", plot = plot, width = 16, height = 10, dpi = 300)
```

### Average Debut Age of Group vs. Solo Artists Across Genres

At first we need to filter the data, remove NA records from genre and artist gender. After that we calculate average birth_year fo artists for groups and take exact birth year for solo artists, calculate debut_age, add new column Solo/Group, group by genre and artist type and find average debut age. Usually, it's pretty similar, but in Latin average age for group is the highest one compared to all other genres and artist types.

```{r}
data <- roll_stone %>% 
  filter(!is.na(genre) & !is.na(artist_gender)) %>% 
  mutate(birth_year = ifelse(artist_member_count > 1,
                             artist_birth_year_sum / artist_member_count,
                             artist_birth_year_sum)) %>% 
  mutate(debut_age = debut_album_release_year - birth_year) %>% 
  mutate(artist_type = ifelse(artist_member_count > 1, "Group", "Solo")) %>% 
  group_by(genre, artist_type) %>% 
  summarise(avg_debut_age = mean(debut_age, na.rm = TRUE), , .groups = "drop") 

selected_colors <- c(stepped(20)[16], stepped(20)[8])

plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = genre, y = avg_debut_age, group = artist_type, color = artist_type)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +  
  geom_point(size = 3) +  
  labs(title = "Average Debut Age of Group vs. Solo Artists Across Genres", 
       x = "Genre", y = "Average Debut Age", color = "Artist Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
        legend.position = "top") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(15, 50), 
                     breaks = seq(15, 50, by = 5)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = selected_colors)

plot 
```

### Album Rank Changes Over Time

At first we reshape the data and filter out missing values for rank and genre. After that, we calculate how much each albumâ€™s rank changes over time by comparing its position to the previous yearâ€™s rank. Finally, we create an animated plot showing the rank changes for each album, with colors representing the change and shapes showing the genre, using a custom stepped color palette for the ranks.

```{r}
data <- roll_stone %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("rank_"),
               names_to = "rank_year",
               values_to = "rank") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(rank) & !is.na(genre)) %>%
  mutate(rank_year = str_extract(rank_year, "\\d{4}")) %>% 
  mutate(rank_year = as.integer(rank_year)) %>% 
  arrange(rank_year, rank)

data <- data %>%
  group_by(album) %>%
  arrange(rank_year) %>%
  mutate(rank_change = rank - lag(rank, default = rank[1])) 


plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = album, y = rank, color = rank_change, shape = genre)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_gradient2(low = stepped(24)[1], mid = stepped(24)[24], high = stepped(24)[13], midpoint = 0) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14)) + 
  labs(title = "Album Rank Changes Over Time: {frame_time}", 
       x = "Album", y = "Rank", color = "Rank Change", shape = "Genre") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        plot.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        ) +
  transition_time(rank_year) +  
  ease_aes('linear')  

animate(plot, fps = 10, duration = 8, width = 900, height = 600, renderer = gifski_renderer())
```
