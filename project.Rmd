This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

```{r}
# Define the required libraries
libs <- c("tidyverse", "ggtext", "patchwork", "cowplot", "gridExtra", "lubridate", "ggthemes")

# Check if libraries are installed; install missing ones
installed_libs <- libs %in% rownames(installed.packages())

if (any(installed_libs == FALSE)) {
    install.packages(libs[!installed_libs])
} else {
    print("All the libraries already installed")
}

# Load the libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggtext)
library(patchwork)
library(cowplot)
library(gridExtra)
library(lubridate)
library(ggthemes)
```

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
# Load the Chicago dataset
chic <- readr::read_csv("rolling_stone.csv")

# Display the first few rows
head(chic)

# chic %>% mutate(diff_birt_debut = debut_album_release_year - artist_birth_year_sum) %>% filter(diff_birt_debut > 0) %>%  group_by(artist_gender) %>% summarize(mean(diff_birt_debut))

# chic %>% filter(artist_member_count > 1) %>%  select(clean_name, artist_member_count) %>% distinct() %>% arrange(clean_name)


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
